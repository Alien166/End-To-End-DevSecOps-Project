##  Architecture  

The deployment is hosted on **AWS**, with the following infrastructure components:  

1. **Jenkins Server**  
   - Automates CI/CD pipeline for Netflix application deployment  
   - Integrates security tools (**SonarQube, Docker, Trivy, OWASP Dependency-Check**)  

2. **Monitoring Server**  
   - Tracks application and system performance  
   - Uses **Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana**  

3. **Kubernetes Master Server**  
   - Controls the cluster and manages deployments  

4. **Kubernetes Worker Server**  
   - which the application will be deployed by the master node

## 🔄 DevSecOps Pipeline Workflow  

1️⃣ **Developers push code** to GitHub  
2️⃣ **Jenkins triggers the CI/CD pipeline**  
3️⃣ **Code is analyzed** using SonarQube for vulnerabilities  
4️⃣ **Trivy scans the Docker image** for security threats  
5️⃣ **OWASP Dependency-Check** scans libraries for vulnerabilities  
6️⃣ **A secure Docker image is built & pushed to DockerHub**  
7️⃣ **Kubernetes deploys the application** to Worker Nodes  
8️⃣ **Monitoring is handled via Prometheus & Grafana**  
9️⃣ **Email alerts notify the team** of security issues
